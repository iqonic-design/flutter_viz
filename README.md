## üîë Environment Variables

To unlock the full power of **FlutterViz**, you‚Äôll need to set up a `.env` file in your project‚Äôs root directory.  
This file holds your private configuration keys‚Äîkeeping your app secure, flexible, and ready for production.

**Here‚Äôs what each variable does:**

- **`BASE_URL`**: The root URL of the backend API that your application communicates with for all data operations and services.
- **`CAPTACHA_SITE_KEY`**: Your Google reCAPTCHA site key, protecting your forms from spam and abuse.
- **`CAPTACHA_SECRET_KEY`**: The secret key for verifying reCAPTCHA responses on the backend.
- **`INVITE_CODE`**: A required code that users must enter during account creation to register and access the application.

**Sample `.env` file:**
```properties
BASE_URL=YOUR_BASE_URL
CAPTACHA_SITE_KEY=YOUR_CAPTACHA_SITE_KEY
CAPTACHA_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_CAPTACHA_SECRET_KEY
INVITE_CODE=YOUR_INVITE_CODE
```
